## Overview

In this week, students explored how data is stored and manipulated efficiently using key data structures and algorithms in Java. Topics included linked lists, stacks, queues, maps, sorting and searching techniques, file input/output handling, and foundational algorithm analysis.

## Topics Covered

### 01: Data Structure Introduction and LinkedList
- What is a data structure?
- Types of data structures: linear vs. non-linear
- Implementation and operations of `LinkedList` in Java
- Use cases and advantages of linked lists

### 02: Stack, Queue, HashMap, and Hashing Function
- Stack (LIFO) operations using `Stack` class
- Queue (FIFO) operations using `Queue` interface and `LinkedList` class
- `HashMap` for key-value data storage
- Basics of hashing and how hash functions work

### 03: Sorting Algorithms
- Common sorting techniques:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Time complexity comparisons

### 04 & 05: Search Algorithms and Java I/O Classes
- Linear Search and Binary Search
- Understanding search time complexities
- Working with:
  - `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`
  - `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, `InputStreamReader` for file input and output operations

### 06: Algorithm's Runtime Analysis & Big-O Notation
- Concept of algorithm efficiency
- Time and space complexity
- Big-O notation explained
- Best, average, and worst-case scenarios
